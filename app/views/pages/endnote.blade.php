    Dover Park Hospice continually aims to create the very best environment possible for terminally ill patients to receive consistent care services along their end-of-life journey from a team of Palliative Care professionals and support staff.
</p>
<p>
    We are deeply committed to provide the critical “touchpoints of care” at the crucial last stage of life.
</p>
<p>
    This project is timely as it provides valuable insights and snippets from hospice patients, families and caregivers who had benefitted from the extensive support received, to navigate the end-of-life journey with confidence and ease.
</p>
<p>
    People are generally more aware and open to be empowered and hence, proactive in managing end-of-life issues and this has helped patients to pass on peacefully with comfort, grace and dignity;  for our patients, <strong><i>"Every Moment Matters"</i></strong>.
